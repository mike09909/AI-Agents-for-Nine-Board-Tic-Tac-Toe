# Game Description

## Overview

This document provides a detailed description of the game mechanics and implementation details.

## Key Components

### Agent Training

- The agent is trained using reinforcement learning techniques
- Training process involves iterative learning through environment interactions
- Agent learns optimal policies through reward-based feedback

### Game Environment

- Provides the interface for agent-environment interaction
- Handles state transitions and reward calculations
- Maintains game rules and constraints

### Reward System

- Rewards are given based on agent performance
- Positive rewards for desired behaviors
- Negative rewards for undesired actions
- Reward shaping helps guide learning

### State Representation

- Game state is represented in a format suitable for the agent
- Includes relevant features and observations
- May include both raw and processed state information

### Action Space

- Defines all possible actions available to the agent
- May be discrete or continuous
- Actions affect state transitions

## Implementation Details

### Training Process

1. Initialize agent and environment
2. For each episode:
   - Reset environment
   - While episode not done:
     - Agent selects action
     - Environment executes action
     - Calculate rewards
     - Update agent policy
3. Save trained model

### Key Parameters

- Learning rate
- Discount factor
- Exploration rate
- Batch size
- Network architecture

## Usage

1. Set up the environment
2. Configure training parameters
3. Run training script
4. Evaluate agent performance
5. Deploy trained agent

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, Gym)
- Additional game-specific dependencies

## Notes

- Regular checkpointing recommended during training
- Monitor training metrics for convergence
- Adjust hyperparameters as needed
